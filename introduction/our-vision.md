# Our Vision

## Leading the Meta-Revolution of Digitalization and Globalization



Xphere sets forth a grand vision of the "meta-revolution" in a world where digitalization and globalization are advancing, providing a blueprint to realize this vision. The Xphere mainnet serves as the foundation for a global WEB 3.0 public blockchain service, offering various blockchain services including government systems, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and real-world assets (RWAs). These services maintain independent ecosystems while being interconnected, enabling services such as borderless asset movement, identity authentication, and qualification verification.



Individual users can make payments anywhere in the world without constraints using CBDCs or stablecoins stored in their digital wallets. This greatly enhances the convenience of global financial transactions by allowing access to and exchange of CBDCs from other countries in real-time through blockchain technology. Additionally, real-world assets such as copyrights, land, securities, and buildings can be easily traded anywhere in the world via blockchain, significantly increasing asset liquidity. Furthermore, personal identity information and qualifications are securely stored on the blockchain, replacing traditional passports or licenses. Users can sell their activity data where needed and access various public blockchain applications (DApps).



Xphere is building a global integrated network that embraces individuals, government agencies, and businesses, aiming to create a next-generation blockchain network optimized for real-world usage. This focus is on maximizing the potential of blockchain technology in the era of Web 3.0.
