# Xphere Overview

## Key Features of Xphere Blockchain



Xphere blockchain is composed of innovative technology and unique functionalities. This platform enhances scalability significantly through our special 'X-Chain mechanism' while maintaining the decentralization of traditional PoW (Proof of Work) and network security. This mechanism is designed to operate reliably even in large-scale networks.

2. **High Transaction Processing Speed (TPS)**\
   Our technology offers very high transaction processing speeds required in real-world applications, preventing bottlenecks that may occur when a large number of users simultaneously use the network.&#x20;
3. **Low Network Fees**\
   Xphere provides users with very low network fees, enabling everyone to utilize blockchain technology at a minimal cost.&#x20;
4. **Integration with Industries**\
   Our blockchain platform is designed to easily integrate with various industries, making it particularly suitable for national projects such as government's digital currency (CBDC) projects.&#x20;
5. **Scalability for Large-Scale Users**\
