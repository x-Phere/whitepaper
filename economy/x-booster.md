## X-Booster: Accelerated Growth of the Ecosystem through X-Booster

In the constantly evolving blockchain technology sector, maintaining the value of network currency and ensuring sustainable growth requires careful economic policies. To achieve these goals, the Xphere network has adopted a block reward reduction strategy. This strategy aims to regulate the supply of network currency by adjusting the amount of rewards received at specific intervals during block creation, thereby suppressing inflation and promoting coin value stabilization.



### X-Booster Strategy

The Xphere blockchain has introduced an innovative strategy called X-Booster to ensure initial network growth and stability. This strategy involves rapidly increasing mining speed in the initial stages and then stabilizing the network economy through subsequent block reward reductions.

Initial Acceleration : The Xphere network doubled the mining speed from 1 block per minute to 1 block every 30 seconds for the first 500,000 blocks. This accelerated network activity and efficiently distributed coins in the initial stage.

Block Reward Reduction : After 500,000 blocks, the block reward reduction strategy is implemented. The Xphere network operates by reducing the block reward amount by 0.8181818 times every 500,000 blocks. This establishes a foundation for controlling the supply rate of network currency in the long term and ensuring sustainable growth.



### Objectives of Block Reward Reduction

The block reward reduction strategy of the Xphere network is designed to achieve various objectives beyond simply changing the reward amount:

Inflation Suppression: Block reward reduction reduces the rate of increase in the supply of network currency, effectively suppressing inflation. This contributes to reducing coin value volatility and stabilization.

Long-term Sustainability Assurance: The block reward reduction strategy establishes a foundation for the network's sustainable growth in the long term. A limited amount of coins supplied at a steady rate helps maintain the stability of network value and increases the potential for long-term growth.

Network Growth Inducement: The rapid block rewards in the initial stages incentivize initial mining participation and stimulate network activation. This enhances network effects and contributes to ecosystem development.

Optimization of Token Economic Model: Block reward reduction optimizes the economic model of network tokens and establishes a foundation for sustainable growth. By maintaining a balance between supply and demand, it enables simultaneous coin value stabilization and long-term growth.

High Potential for Value Increase: Advancing the first halving accelerates the reduction in supply, increasing the potential for value appreciation.

Enhanced Role of X-Guardians: X-Booster supports active governance alliance activities from the early stages of the network, contributing to network development.
